    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets.\n",
    "This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind.\n",
    "The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: *NumPy* for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, *Pandas* for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, *SciPy* for common scientific computing tasks, *Matplotlib* for publication-quality visualizations, *IPython* for interactive execution and sharing of code, *Scikit-Learn* for machine learning, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a guide to the Python language itself, I would suggest the sister project to this book, \"[A Whirlwind Tour of the Python Language](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)\".\n",
    "This short report provides a tour of the essential features of the Python language, aimed at data scientists who already are familiar with one or more other programming languages."

    "Installing Python and the suite of libraries that enable scientific computing is straightforward . This section will outline some of the considerations when setting up your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are various ways to install Python, the one ew would suggest for use in data science is the Anaconda distribution, which works similarly whether you use Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.\n",
    "The Anaconda distribution comes in two flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) gives you the Python interpreter itself, along with a command-line tool called ``conda`` which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared toward Python packages, similar in spirit to the apt or yum tools that Linux users might be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) includes both Python and conda, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing. Because of the size of this bundle, expect the installation to consume several gigabytes of disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any of the packages included with Anaconda can also be installed manually on top of Miniconda; while in case of Anaconda all the packages are installed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation of any other package is usually as easy as typing **``conda install packagename``**.\n",
    "For more information on conda, including information about creating and using conda environments (which we would *highly* recommend), refer to [conda's online documentation](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/).\n",

    "IPython (short for *Interactive Python*) was started in 2001 by Fernando Perez as an enhanced Python interpreter, and has since grown into a project aiming to provide, in Perez's words, \"Tools for the entire life cycle of research computing.\"\n",

    "# IPython Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous two sections showed how IPython lets you use and explore Python efficiently and interactively.\n",
    "Here we'll begin discussing some of the enhancements that IPython adds on top of the normal Python syntax.\n",
    "These are known in IPython as *magic commands*, and are prefixed by the ``%`` character.\n",
    "These magic commands are designed to succinctly solve various common problems in standard data analysis.\n",
    "Magic commands come in two flavors: *line magics*, which are denoted by a single ``%`` prefix and operate on a single line of input, and *cell magics*, which are denoted by a double ``%%`` prefix and operate on multiple lines of input.\n",
    "We'll demonstrate and discuss a few brief examples here, and come back to more focused discussion of several useful magic commands later in the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pasting Code Blocks: ``%paste`` and ``%cpaste``\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in the IPython interpreter, one common gotcha is that pasting multi-line code blocks can lead to unexpected errors, especially when indentation and interpreter markers are involved.\n",
    "A common case is that you find some example code on a website and want to paste it into your interpreter.\n",
    "Consider the following simple function:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> def donothing(x):\n",
    "...     return x\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code is formatted as it would appear in the Python interpreter, and if you copy and paste this directly into IPython you get an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [2]: >>> def donothing(x):\n",
    "   ...:     ...     return x\n",
    "   ...:     \n",
    "  File \"<ipython-input-20-5a66c8964687>\", line 2\n",
    "    ...     return x\n",
    "                 ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the direct paste, the interpreter is confused by the additional prompt characters.\n",
    "But never fear–IPython's ``%paste`` magic function is designed to handle this exact type of multi-line, marked-up input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [3]: %paste\n",
    ">>> def donothing(x):\n",
    "...     return x\n",
    "\n",
    "## -- End pasted text --\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``%paste`` command both enters and executes the code, so now the function is ready to be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [4]: donothing(10)\n",
    "Out[4]: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A command with a similar intent is ``%cpaste``, which opens up an interactive multiline prompt in which you can paste one or more chunks of code to be executed in a batch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [5]: %cpaste\n",
    "Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.\n",
    ":>>> def donothing(x):\n",
    ":...     return x\n",
    ":--\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These magic commands, like others we'll see, make available functionality that would be difficult or impossible in a standard Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running External Code: ``%run``\n",
    "As you begin developing more extensive code, you will likely find yourself working in both IPython for interactive exploration, as well as a text editor to store code that you want to reuse.\n",
    "Rather than running this code in a new window, it can be convenient to run it within your IPython session.\n",
    "This can be done with the ``%run`` magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you've created a ``myscript.py`` file with the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#-------------------------------------\n",
    "# file: myscript.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"square a number\"\"\"\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "for N in range(1, 4):\n",
    "    print(N, \"squared is\", square(N))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute this from your IPython session as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [6]: %run myscript.py\n",
    "1 squared is 1\n",
    "2 squared is 4\n",
    "3 squared is 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that after you've run this script, any functions defined within it are available for use in your IPython session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [7]: square(5)\n",
    "Out[7]: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options to fine-tune how your code is run; you can see the documentation in the normal way, by typing **``%run?``** in the IPython interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timing Code Execution: ``%timeit``\n",
    "Another example of a useful magic function is ``%timeit``, which will automatically determine the execution time of the single-line Python statement that follows it.\n",
    "For example, we may want to check the performance of a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [8]: %timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in range(1000)]\n",
    "1000 loops, best of 3: 325 µs per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of ``%timeit`` is that for short commands it will automatically perform multiple runs in order to attain more robust results.\n",
    "For multi line statements, adding a second ``%`` sign will turn this into a cell magic that can handle multiple lines of input.\n",
    "For example, here's the equivalent construction with a ``for``-loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [9]: %%timeit\n",
    "   ...: L = []\n",
    "   ...: for n in range(1000):\n",
    "   ...:     L.append(n ** 2)\n",
    "   ...: \n",
    "1000 loops, best of 3: 373 µs per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can immediately see that list comprehensions are about 10% faster than the equivalent ``for``-loop construction in this case.\n",
    "We'll explore ``%timeit`` and other approaches to timing and profiling code in [Profiling and Timing Code](01.07-Timing-and-Profiling.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Help on Magic Functions: ``?``, ``%magic``, and ``%lsmagic``\n",
    "\n",
    "Like normal Python functions, IPython magic functions have docstrings, and this useful\n",
    "documentation can be accessed in the standard manner.\n",
    "So, for example, to read the documentation of the ``%timeit`` magic simply type this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [10]: %timeit?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation for other functions can be accessed similarly.\n",
    "To access a general description of available magic functions, including some examples, you can type this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [11]: %magic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick and simple list of all available magic functions, type this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [12]: %lsmagic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'll mention that it is quite straightforward to define your own magic functions if you wish.\n",
    "We won't discuss it here, but if you are interested, see the references listed in [More IPython Resources](01.08-More-IPython-Resources.ipynb)."

    "\n",
    "Previously we saw that the IPython shell allows you to access previous commands with the up and down arrow keys, or equivalently the Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n shortcuts.\n",
    "Additionally, in both the shell and the notebook, IPython exposes several ways to obtain the output of previous commands, as well as string versions of the commands themselves.\n",
    "We'll explore those here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IPython's ``In`` and ``Out`` Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "By now I imagine you're quite familiar with the ``In [1]:``/``Out[1]:`` style prompts used by IPython.\n",
    "But it turns out that these are not just pretty decoration: they give a clue as to how you can access previous inputs and outputs in your current session.\n",
    "Imagine you start a session that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [1]: import math\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: math.sin(2)\n",
    "Out[2]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: math.cos(2)\n",
    "Out[3]: -0.4161468365471424\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've imported the built-in ``math`` package, then computed the sine and the cosine of the number 2.\n",
    "These inputs and outputs are displayed in the shell with ``In``/``Out`` labels, but there's more–IPython actually creates some Python variables called ``In`` and ``Out`` that are automatically updated to reflect this history:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [4]: print(In)\n",
    "['', 'import math', 'math.sin(2)', 'math.cos(2)', 'print(In)']\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: Out\n",
    "Out[5]: {2: 0.9092974268256817, 3: -0.4161468365471424}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``In`` object is a list, which keeps track of the commands in order (the first item in the list is a place-holder so that ``In[1]`` can refer to the first command):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [6]: print(In[1])\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Out`` object is not a list but a dictionary mapping input numbers to their outputs (if any):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [7]: print(Out[2])\n",
    "0.9092974268256817\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that not all operations have outputs: for example, ``import`` statements and ``print`` statements don't affect the output.\n",
    "The latter may be surprising, but makes sense if you consider that ``print`` is a function that returns ``None``; for brevity, any command that returns ``None`` is not added to ``Out``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where this can be useful is if you want to interact with past results.\n",
    "For example, let's check the sum of ``sin(2) ** 2`` and ``cos(2) ** 2`` using the previously-computed results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [8]: Out[2] ** 2 + Out[3] ** 2\n",
    "Out[8]: 1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is ``1.0`` as we'd expect from the well-known trigonometric identity.\n",
    "In this case, using these previous results probably is not necessary, but it can become very handy if you execute a very expensive computation and want to reuse the result!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Underscore Shortcuts and Previous Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Python shell contains just one simple shortcut for accessing previous output; the variable ``_`` (i.e., a single underscore) is kept updated with the previous output; this works in IPython as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [9]: print(_)\n",
    "1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But IPython takes this a bit further—you can use a double underscore to access the second-to-last output, and a triple underscore to access the third-to-last output (skipping any commands with no output):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [10]: print(__)\n",
    "-0.4161468365471424\n",

    "In [11]: print(___)\n",
    "0.9092974268256817\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython stops there: more than three underscores starts to get a bit hard to count, and at that point it's easier to refer to the output by line number.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more shortcut we should mention, however–a shorthand for ``Out[X]`` is ``_X`` (i.e., a single underscore followed by the line number):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [12]: Out[2]\n",
    "Out[12]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "\n",
    "In [13]: _2\n",
    "Out[13]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suppressing Output\n",
    "Sometimes you might wish to suppress the output of a statement (this is perhaps most common with the plotting commands that we'll explore in [Introduction to Matplotlib](04.00-Introduction-To-Matplotlib.ipynb)).\n",
    "Or maybe the command you're executing produces a result that you'd prefer not like to store in your output history, perhaps so that it can be deallocated when other references are removed.\n",
    "The easiest way to suppress the output of a command is to add a semicolon to the end of the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [14]: math.sin(2) + math.cos(2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the result is computed silently, and the output is neither displayed on the screen or stored in the ``Out`` dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [15]: 14 in Out\n",
    "Out[15]: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related Magic Commands\n",
    "For accessing a batch of previous inputs at once, the ``%history`` magic command is very helpful.\n",
    "Here is how you can print the first four inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [16]: %history -n 1-4\n",
    "   1: import math\n",
    "   2: math.sin(2)\n",
    "   3: math.cos(2)\n",
    "   4: print(In)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, you can type ``%history?`` for more information and a description of options available.\n",
    "Other similar magic commands are ``%rerun`` (which will re-execute some portion of the command history) and ``%save`` (which saves some set of the command history to a file).\n",
    "For more information, I suggest exploring these using the ``?`` help functionality discussed in [Help and Documentation in IPython](01.01-Help-And-Documentation.ipynb)."
